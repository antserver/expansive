            <h1>Configuration</h1>

			<p>Expansive is configured by an <em>expansive.json</em> configuration file that controls the 
			initial meta data, directory names, file patterns to process, ports to serve and processing 
			instructions. Expansive uses sensible defaults so you typically do not need to configure much. 
			Here is a typical expansive.json file:</p>

			<pre class="ui code segment">
	{
	  meta: {
	    url: 'https://embedthis.com/',
	  },
	  control: {
	    copy: [ 'images' ],
	  },
	  services: {
	    'compress':  false,
	    'minify-js':  false,
	    'minify-css': false
	 }
	}
			</pre>
			<p>The Meta property section defines the default public URL for the site. The <em>copy</em> property provides a 
			hint to Expansive that anything under the 'images' directory should be copied and not processed by the Expansive 
			pipeline. The <em>services</em> property set provides configuration for the plugin services to control their 
			operation and enable/disable minification and compression services.</p> 

			<p>If you require a scripted configuration, you can alternatively use an <em>expansive.es</em> script file 
			instead of the expansive.json. For more details, see the reference configuration section.</p>
