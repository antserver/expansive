            <h1>Processing Pipeline</h1>
			<p>So far, we have processed simply HTML pages, but Expansive can render other file types such as 
				<a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">Markdown</a> or 
				<a href="https://embedthis.com/esp/">ESP</a>. To process Markdown files, first install the 
				<a href="https://embedthis.com/catalog/#/?keywords=exp-md">Markdown</a> plugin.</p>
				<pre class="ui code segment">$ pak install exp-md
	[Cached] exp-md 0.2.0</pre>

				<p>Now create a sample markdown page, create a document called
				<em>contents/greeting.html.md</em> with the following content:</p>
			 <pre class="ui code segment">
	# Greetings
	Expansive **expands** your mind.
	</pre>
			<p>Expansive will render this and create <em>dist/greeting.html</em> which will look like:</p>
	   		<pre class="ui code segment">
	&lt;html>
	&lt;head>
	    &lt;title>Blog&lt;/title>
	&lt;/head>
	&lt;body>
	    <b>&lt;h1 id="greetings">Greetings&lt;/h1>
	    &lt;p>Expansive <strong>expands</strong> your mind.&lt;/p></b>
	    &lt;script src="lib/jquery/jquery.js">&lt;/script>
	&lt;/body>
	&lt;/html>
	</pre>
			<p>Expansive renders the web site by processing all files in the <em>contents</em> directory. 
			It interprets the all file's extensions, one by one. For example: if a file were named 
			<em>page.html.md</em> it would invoke the markdown processor for the <em>.md</em> extension, 
			then it would invokek the <em>.html</em> processor before saving the final result under the 
			<em>dist</em> directory. A file can have any number of extensions and they will be processed 
			from the outside-inwards.</p>
