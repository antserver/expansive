            <h1>Plugins</h1>

			<p>Plugins are a special class of extension that provides core processing for the Expansive 
			pipeline. Plugins provide <em>services</em> that are used to transform a file from one extension 
			to another. For example: the <em>exp-md</em> plugin provides the <em>compile-markdown-html</em> service that transforms <em>.md</em> files into
			standard <em>.html</em> files.</p>
