      <h1>Partial Pages</h1>

      <p>Sometimes you have a portion of content that needs to be shared over multiple pages. It may be a navigation bar,
      page footer, or common piece of scripting. While <a href="layouts">Layout</a> pages provide for reuse of the outermost
      page content, Partial Pages provide the ability to reuse any inner portion of content.</p>

      <p>A partial page is invoked via the <em>partial(name)</em> Javascript function. This function is processed when the
      site is rendered and the function call is replaced with the contents of the processed partial page. For example, 
      consider the following page layout.</p>
<code class="inverted">&lt;!DOCTYPE html>
&lt;html lang="en">
&lt;head>
    <b>&lt;@ partial('head') @></b>
&lt;/head>
&lt;body>
    <b>&lt;@ partial('nav') @></b>
    &lt;@ content @>
&lt;/body>
&lt;/html>
</code>

      <h2>Creating Partial Pages</h2>
      <p>A partial page is no different from any other web page except that it does not do layout processing and so does not
      have a <em>&lt;@ content @></em> element. A partial page may reference other partial pages and may include any 
      Expansive pipeline processing. For example, a HTML page may include a partial page that is defined using Markdown.</p>

      <h2>Passing Parameters to Partial Pages</h2>
      <p>Data may be passed to partial pages by either setting properties in the page's meta data. 
      Pages have an optional special area between braces at the top of the page to define page meta data. 
      This provides data values that can be passed to partial and layout pages to be accessed via scripting.
      For example:</p>

      <code class="inverted">{
    <b>color: 'red'</b>,
    title: 'Hello World'
}    

&lt;@ partial('hero') @>
</code>

      <p>This passes the <em>color</em> and <em>title</em> meta data properties to the <em>hero</em> partial page. 
      The hero page will receive the parameter in its meta data and can access this via the <em>meta</em> global property.
      For example (partials/hero.html.exp):</p>

      <code class="inverted">&lt;p>The color is: &lt;&#64;= meta.color @></code>

      <p>You can pass parameters to a single partial page via the <em>partial</em>() function call. For example:</p>
      <code class="inverted">&lt;@ partial('hero', { color: 'rec' }) @></code>



    <h2>Selecting Layouts</h2>
    <p>A content page can request a different layout by adding a <em>layout</em>
    property to the meta data section of the content page. For example:</p>
    <code class="inverted">{
    layout: 'product-layout'
    title:  'Hello World'
}    
&lt;h1>Hello World with Layouts&lt;/h1>
</code>
    <p>This will select the <em>product-layout</em> in the <em>layouts</em> directory.
    Expansive resolves layout pages by looking for a layout file that begins with the layout name in the <em>layouts</em>
    directory. The default page layout is called <em>default</em> and resolves to <em>layouts/default.html.exp</em>.</p>
		The <em>.exp</em> extension indicates that this page contains embedded Expansive script that should be processed during
    rendering. The <em>Date().format</em> code above is executed when Expansive renders the site and is replaced with 
    the current date string.</p>
