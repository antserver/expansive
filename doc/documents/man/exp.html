<b>description</b>
       <b>expansive  </b>is  a  static web site generator using ejscript.  it quickly
       creates static html pages from layouts, partials and content pages.

<b>why expansive?</b>
       there are many static site generators, why another one?  existing  site
       generators are often slow, very slow, painfully slow.  when creating or
       managing a web site, you need tools that  do  not  delay  the  creative
       design process. they need to be as fast as possible. expansive is fast,
       pure and simple.

       other site generators frequently provide poor  diagnostics.  fine  when
       everything  works, but when a page fails to generate due to a scripting
       error -- debugging can be a nightmare. expansive  shows  exactly  where
       errors occur.

<b>features</b>
       expansive is implemented primarily as a single script of some 900 lines
       of ejscript and is very hackable.  it has the following major features:

           . generate static site from pages, layouts, partials and scripts
           . ejscript templates for dynamic content
           . layout pages to define the look and feel of site
           . partial pages to include replicated content
           . per-page meta data to control layouts and partials
           . integrated web server to serve content
           . watches for changes and automatically regenerates site
           . scripting support via change events
           . automatic sitemap generation
           . content transition pipeline
           . open plugin architecture for new transitions

<b>nice parts</b>
       while  expansive  has a strong feature set, there are some characteris-
       tics that make expansive particularly sweet.

           . fast, fast, fast
           . full power of ejscript in every page
           . very simple code. by leveraging ejscript, the code is simple  and
       clean
           . great diagnostics when things go wrong

<b>basic usage</b>
       to  prepare a directory for expansive and create an exp.json configura-
       tion file:
           exp init

       to generate a site from 'documents' into 'final'
           exp generate

       to serve content and watch for changes
           exp

       to watch for changes but not serve
           exp watch

       to generate a matching set of documents
           exp documents/index.html
           exp documents/manual

       to clean the generated site
           exp clean

<b>directories</b>
       expansive uses the following directories:

           layouts     for master page layouts
           partials    for partial web pages that can  be  included  by  other
       pages
           documents   input web pages to be processed
           files       files to be copied and not processed
           final       final output directory containing the rendered web site

       these directories can be modified via the 'directories' object  in  the
       meta data collection.

<b>processing</b>
       expansive  operates by processing web pages from the 'documents' direc-
       tory. it uses master layout pages  from  the  'layouts'  directory  and
       includes  partial pages from the 'partials' directory. raw files may be
       copied from the 'files' directory.  content is rendered to the  'final'
       output directory.

<b>configuration</b>
       expansive  is  controlled  by  a  'exp.json'  configuration  file. this
       defines top level configuration for the site and controls how expansive
       generates  the  site. an exp.json file must be present for expansive to
       generate a content.

       to prepare a new site to use expansive, run:

           exp init

       this creates an exp.json file similar to that below:

             {
                title: 'home page title',
                url: 'home page url',
                description: 'meta data description (optional)',
                keywords: 'meta data keywords (optional)',
                control: {
                    exclude: [ ],
                    copy: [ ],
                    script: '',
                    sitemap: {
                        include: '/\.html/'
                    }
                }
             }

       the contents of the exp.json file are added to the expansive meta  data
       collection  that  is  provided  to  every page, layout and partial. the
       exp.json file has a 'control' section that controls  the  operation  of
       expansive.  the  are  a  set of pre-defined properties, but you can add
       your own data as well. see the meta properties section below.

       in the control section, the 'exclude' array defines a set of file  pat-
       terns  to  exclude  from  processing. the 'copy' array defines a set of
       file patterns to copy without processing. these patterns  are  relative
       to  the  'documents'  directory.  the script string defines an optional
       global script to inject code into the ejscript execution  context.  the
       sitemap  collection  configures what documents to include in the gener-
       ated sitemap xml file.

<b>dynamic content</b>
       expansive uses embedded  javascript  in  web  pages  to  fully  support
       dynamic content.  scripts can be embedded via the special expansive tag
       '&lt;% ...  %&gt;'. this will run the script when the page is  generated  and
       replace the script with generated data.  for example:

        &lt;p&gt;today is &lt;% write(date()) %&gt;

       the write function is used to render data to be used in place of the &lt;%
       %&gt; element.  you can use 'writesafe' to html  escape  the  data  before
       writing.  you can also use a simpler form &lt;%= that means use the result
       of the javascript expression, html escapse the data and then write  it.
       for example:

        &lt;p&gt;today is &lt;%= date() %&gt;

       even  simpler,  you can use an abbreviated @@variable to emit the value
       of a javascript variable. for example:

        &lt;p&gt;site url is @@{meta.url}&lt;/p&gt;

<b>transformations</b>
       expansive will interpret document extensions and  automatically  trans-
       form  content  from  one  format to another.  for example, the filename
       'instructions.html.md' tells expansive that the  data  is  in  markdown
       format  via  the  '.md' extension and it should be converted to 'html'.
       expansive will examine each nested extension and process  the  document
       until it reaches an extension for which there is no further transforma-
       tions defined.

       expansive uses the '.exp' extension to specify the document has  embed-
       ded ejscript. for example:

        index.html.md.exp

       this  means  the  file  is  a markdown file that has embedded ejscript.
       expansive will process this by first  running  the  embedded  ejscript,
       then  piping  through  the  markdown  filter  and  saving the result as
       'index.html' after applying the appropriate layout.

<b>layouts</b>
       a layout page defines the top level html content for a  set  of  pages.
       the  layout  defines  the format, look and feel of the web site so that
       each pages does not need to replicate this content.  despite  the  fact
       that  pages  nominate  a layout page to use, it is actually layout page
       that includes the content page inside it to create  a  composite  page.
       the  '&lt;%  content %&gt;' tag in the layout is replaced with the actual web
       page data after separating the page meta data.

       there can be multiple layout pages and the  default  layout  is  called
       'default.html.exp'.  layout  pages  can  use any desired transformation
       file extension.

             &lt;!doctype html&gt;
             &lt;html lang="en"&gt;
             &lt;head&gt;
                 &lt;title&gt;&lt;%= meta.title %&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
                 &lt;link href="css/api.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" /&gt;
             &lt;/head&gt;
             &lt;body&gt;
                 &lt;div class="content"&gt;
                     &lt;% content %&gt;
                 &lt;/div&gt;
             &lt;/body&gt;
             &lt;/html&gt;

<b>partials</b>
       web pages often need to have content that is common  across  a  set  of
       pages.  expansive  supports this via partial pages that can be included
       by any page, layout or other partial page. a page specifies  a  partial
       by using the 'partial' javascript function. for example:

        &lt;% partial('header') %&gt;

       the partial function will search for a file starting with 'header.html'
       in the 'partials' directory.  partials  are  transformed  according  to
       their  extension.  if  a partial called 'header.html.md.exp' was found,
       then it will be first transformed by  running  the  embedded  ejscript,
       then  piping the output into the markdown to create html data that will
       then be included in place of the original partial tag.

       partials can be nested, in that a partial page may include another par-
       ital page to any depth.

<b>meta data</b>
       pages, layouts and partials can define meta data at the top of the file
       via a javascript literal.  meta data is passed to the  ejscript  execu-
       tion  context for each page, layout and partial where scripts can exam-
       ine and use in rendering pages.

             {
                draft: true,
                navigation: 'blog',
             }
             &lt;h1&gt;page header&lt;/h1&gt;

       the meta data is added to the current meta data collection  and  passed
       to  the  layout  page and any partials used by the page.  the meta data
       can be accessed via the 'expansive.meta' javascript property.

       meta data is inherited and aggregated as expansive processes a web site
       directory. the meta data from upper directories is passed down to lower
       directories. in this manner upper levels can define the parameters  for
       subdirectories in the site. meta data is never passed back up the tree.

       meta data can also be defined by including additional 'exp.json'  files
       at any level in the documents directory.

<b>meta properties</b>
       expansive  defines a rich set of meta properties for you to use in your
       pages:

       basename    basename portion of the final document filename.

       date        generation date of the document.

       extension   the extension of the final document filename.

       extensions  the set of extensions on the original input document.

       ispartial   true if the page being processed is a partial page.

       layout      layout page in use. set to '' if no layout being used.

       mode        index in the modes property. the selected property  collec-
                   tion is copied up to the top level of the meta data.

       modes       array  of  property  collections.  used  to define 'debug',
                   'release' configurations.

       outpath     final output filename for the document.

       page        filename of the page being processed in documents.

       partial     name of the partial page being processed.

       path        input filename of the document.

       top         url for the top level home page of the site.

       url         url for the current page.

<b>meta control</b>
       expansive defines a set of control properites in the meta.control:

       copy        array of patterns to copy without processing. the  patterns
                   may  include  "*"  or "**". if a directory is specifed, all
                   files under the directory are copied.

       directories directories collection. entries for  'documents',  'files',
                   'final', 'layouts', and 'partials'.

       exclude     array  of patterns to exclude from processing. the patterns
                   may include "*" or "**". if a directory  is  specifed,  all
                   files under the directory are excluded.

       listen      address on which to listen for http requests. may be just a
                   port number.

       plugins     list of plugins to use.

       script      script to  evaluate  to  inject  code  into  the  expansive
                   ejscript global execution context.

       sitemap     control what files to include in a sitemap.

       transforms  cache of plugin transformations

       watch       time in milliseconds to wait between checking for regenera-
                   tion.

<b>using plugins</b>
       expansive may be extended via plugins that provide transformations  and
       additional  scripting  capability.  a site specifies the plugins to use
       via dependencies in its package.json file or via a 'dependencies' field
       in  its  exp.json.  when a plugin is installed via the pak utility, pak
       will add the plugin automatically to the dependencies property in pack-
       age.json. pak will create a package.json if required.

<b>creating plugins</b>
       expansive    plugins    are    created    using    the    pak   utility
       (https://embedthis.com/pak)  and  published  to  the  pak  catalog   at
       (https://embedthis.com/catalog/).  the  plugin  contains a package.json
       file that includes an app.expansive property collection. for example:

        {
           name: 'my-plugin',
           version: '1.0.0',
           app: {
               expansive: {
                   transforms: {
                       'my-extension': {
                           render: `
                               function transform(data, file, meta) {
                                   return transformed-data
                               }
                           `
                       }
                   }
                   script: 'any script here'
               }
           }
        }

       the plugin specifies a set of transformations via the 'transforms' col-
       lection.  the keys are the supported document filename extensions to be
       transformed and the key  value  is  a  transformation  definition  that
       includes a render property.  this render property is a script that will
       be invoked to transform matching documents. it is invoked with the data
       to  transform (string), the target filename (path) and the current meta
       data collection. the function should return the transformed data.

       a plugin may also define any ejscript code via the  'script'  property.
       this  will  be injected into the global scope of expansive when it exe-
       cutes.

<b>scripting</b>
       expansive defines a top level global named "expansive" to access expan-
       sive  services. this object provides the following properties and meth-
       ods:

       getfilemeta(filename)
              to return the meta data specified in the given file.

       collection({key: value})
              to return a list of  matching  documents  that  have  meta  data
              matching the specified keys and values.

       trace(tag, msg...)
              to emit console trace while processing.

<b>commands</b>
       clean  remove generated content from the 'final' output directory.

       init   initialize  a  directory by creating an 'exp.json' configuration
              file.

       generate
              generate the site by processing files  from  'documents',  'lay-
              outs', 'partials' and 'files' into the 'final' output directory.

       watch  watch for changes to 'documents', 'layouts' and  'partials'  and
              regenerate  the  modified  files.  changes to 'layouts' or 'par-
              tials' will cause the entire site to be regenerated.

       &lt;cr&gt;   running exp without any arguments will cause  run  the  embedded
              web  server  to serve the site. by default expansive will listen
              on port 4000. this can be modified via the 'listen' property  in
              the meta collection.

       patterns ...
              providing  a  list of patterns to filter the set of documents to
              generate.  expansive will generate only the documents that begin
              with the given patterns.

<b>options</b>
       <b>--chdir directory</b>
                 change to directory before running.

       <b>--gen     </b>used  with  the  'watch'  command to do an initial generation
                 before watching for changes.

       <b>--keep uri</b>
                 keep intermediate files when transforming content. useful for
                 debugging.

       <b>--listen ip:port uri</b>
                 change  the port on which expansive will listen. can omit the
                 ip portion and only specify a port.

       <b>--log filename:level</b>
                 omit trace to the specified file. the level  is  a  verbosity
                 level  from  0-5  with  5  being  the most verbose.  the '-v'
                 option is an alias for level 1.   can  also  abbreviate  this
                 switch  by  just  specify  a level option. for example: '-5'.
                 http requests and http headers will be traced at levels  2-4.

       <b>--noclean </b>do  not  clean  the  'final'  directory before generating. by
                 default expansive will remove all the content  under  'final'
                 before generating.

       <b>--nowatch </b>do not watch for changes when serving content.

       <b>--quiet   </b>run in quiet mode. do not emit activity trace to the console.

       <b>--verbose </b>run in verbose mode. emit more activity trace.

       <b>--versions uri</b>
                 show exp version information.
