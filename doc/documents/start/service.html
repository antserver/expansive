            <h1>Running Expansive as a System Service or Daemon</h1>
            <p>After installation, Expansive is started automatically as a system service or daemon. You can change this
            behavior and only start Expansive manually if you wish.</p>
            <p>This page gives generic and windows -specific information about starting and stopping the Expansive service.</p>

            <h2>Generic Instructions</h2>
            <p>Expansive includes a manager program called <em>appman</em>. This program is used to configure the running 
            of Expansive as service. Appman provides a generic way to install/uninstall, enable/disable, start/stop, and
            run the Expansive service regardless of the Operating System.</p>
            <p>The Appman command takes the form:</p>
            <pre class="ui code segment">appman commands...</pre>
            <p>Where commands can be:</p>
            <table title="commands" class="ui table segment">
                <thead><tr><th>Command</th><th>Details</th></tr></thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr><td>install</td><td>Install Expansive service</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>uninstall</td><td>Uninstall Expansive service</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>enable</td><td>Enable Expansive to start automatically on system boot</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>disable</td><td>Disable Expansive from automatically starting</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>start</td><td>Start Expansive manually</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>stop</td><td>Stop Expansive</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>run</td><td>Run Expansive and monitor its execution. Restart if it fails.</td></tr>

            <h3>Stopping Expansive as a Service</h3>
            <p>Use the following command to stop Expansive running as a service permanently:</p>
            <pre class="ui code segment">
appman disable
</pre>
            <p>Run the following commands to restore Expansive running as a service:</p>
            <pre class="ui code segment">
appman enable
appman start
</pre>
            <a id="windows"></a>
            <h2>Windows Instructions</h2>
            <p>On Windows, Expansive is managed by two programs:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="#appman">The Expansive Manager</a></li>
                <li><a href="#monitor">The Expansive Monitor</a></li>
            </ul><a id="appman"></a>
            <p>The Appman manager program is installed as a windows service that starts, 
            manages and restarts Expansive. If Expansive fails, Appman will automatically restart it.</p>
            <p>Windows services run in the background with little interaction with the user. So to provide more
            convenient access to manage Expansive, the <a href="#monitor">Expansive Monitor</a> program runs and is
            accessible from the windows system tray (taskbar notification area). You can start and stop Expansive using
            either the manager or Monitor programs.</p>
            <h3>Appman &mdash; Expansive Manager Service</h3>
            <p>You can interface with the Appman program via the Windows Services Applet. To invoke the applet select:</p>
            <pre class="ui code segment">
Start -&gt; Control Panel -&gt; Administrative Tools -&gt; Services
</pre>
            <p>Then select and double click on the <b>Embedthis Expansive</b> service. A dialog panel will be displayed
            from which you can start and stop the manager (appman) process.</p>

            <img src="../images/services.jpg" alt="services" class="bare-screen" />
            <p>When started or stopped, the manager will first do the same operation on the real Expansive instance. Pausing
            the manager will have no effect on Expansive, but will pause the manager itself.</p>
            <p>Once installed, you will need to start the service via the Services control applet.</p>
            <a id="monitor"></a>
            <h3>Expansive Monitor</h3>
            <p>The Windows Expansive Monitor is launched when you log in. It a quick and easy way to start, stop, and
            restart Expansive. You can also launch a browser to display the documentation or the Expansive management console
            (future feature).</p>

            <img src="../images/tray.jpg" alt="tray" class="bare-screen" />
            <p>When you select 'stop' Expansive, you actually stop the manager process which in turn stops Expansive. Similarly,
            when you select 'start' Expansive, you are really starting the manager which detects that Expansive is not running
            and automatically launches it. </p>
