exp

            <p>Expansive is configured by default to listen on port 7777. To test that it is serving pages, point your
            browser at http://localhost:7777. To tailor the Embedthis Expansive configuration, including the default port,
            you may wish to edit the <b>exp.conf</b> configuration file.</p>
            <p>To get all the options for Expansive, read the man page via:</p>
            <pre class="ui code segment">
man exp
</pre>or get the command help via:
            <pre class="ui code segment">
exp --help
</pre>
