        <h1>Embedthis Expansive&trade; Overview</h1>
        <p>Expansive is a fast and flexible static web site generator. It quickly creates HTML 
        pages from layouts, partials and contents pages. Expansive brings dynamic content to 
        static web sites and powerful templating to all.</p>

        <h2>Why Expansive?</h2>
        <p>There are two key reasons we created Expansive.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>There are many web site site generators, so why create another one? 
            The problem is that most existing site generators are slow, very slow, often painfully slow. When 
            creating or managing a web site, you need tools that do not delay the creative design process. 
            They need to be as fast as possible. Expansive is designed to be fast, without sacrificing features.</li>
            <li>The second reason is that existing site generators frequently provide poor diagnostics. 
            This may be fine when everything works, but when a page fails to render due to a scripting error -- 
            debugging can be a nightmare.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Expansive addresses these two flaws: Expansive is very fast to generate and update site contents,
        and if you have made a script error, it shows exactly where the error is.</p>
        <p>That was the genesis, however, Expansive has now gone beyond its original goals and now offers a 
        powerful, flexible environment for creating web sites.</p>

        <h2>Extensive Features</h2>
        <p>Expansive will generate static web sites from pages, layouts, partials and scripts. It has 
            the following major features:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Ejscript templates for dynamic content</li>
        <li>Layout pages to define the look and feel of site</li>
        <li>Partial pages to include replicated content</li>
        <li>Per-page meta data to control layouts and partials</li>
        <li>Integrated web server to serve content</li>
        <li>Watch for changes and automatically render site</li>
        <li>Scripting support via change events</li>
        <li>Automatic sitemap creation</li>
        <li>Content transition pipeline</li>
        <li>Open plugin architecture</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Nice Parts</h2>
        <p>While Expansive has a strong feature set, there are some characteristics that make Expansive particularly sweet.</p>
        <ul>

            <li>Great diagnostics when things go wrong</li>
        </ul>
