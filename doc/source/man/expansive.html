<B>DESCRIPTION</B>
       <B>Expansive </B>is a fast and flexible static web site generator.  It quickly
       creates HTML pages from layouts, partials and content pages.  Expansive
       brings dynamic content to static web sites.

<B>WHY EXPANSIVE?</B>
       There are many web site site generators, why another one? Existing site
       generators are slow, very slow, often painfully slow.  When creating or
       managing  a  web  site,  you  need tools that do not delay the creative
       design process. They need to be  as  fast  as  possible.  Expansive  is
       designed to be fast, without sacrificing features.

       Futher, other site generators frequently provide poor diagnostics. Fine
       when everything works, but when a page fails to render due to a script-
       ing  error  --  debugging  can  be a nightmare. Expansive shows exactly
       where errors occur.

<B>FEATURES</B>
       Expansive generates static web sites from pages, layouts, partials  and
       scripts. It has the following major features:

           . Ejscript templates for dynamic content
           . Layout pages to define the look and feel of site
           . Partial pages to include replicated content
           . Per-page meta data to control layouts and partials
           . Integrated web server to serve content
           . Watches for changes and automatically render site
           . Scripting support via change events
           . Automatic sitemap creation
           . Content transition pipeline
           . Open plugin architecture

<B>NICE PARTS</B>
       While  Expansive  has a strong feature set, there are some characteris-
       tics that make Expansive particularly sweet.

           . Fast, fast, fast
           . Full power of Ejscript in every page
           . Very simple code. By leveraging Ejscript, the code is simple  and
       clean
           . Easy to create and install new plugins
           . Great diagnostics when things go wrong

<B>BASIC USAGE</B>
       To  prepare a directory for expansive and create an expansive.json con-
       figuration file:
           exp init

       To install new plugins to  transform  content.  The  exp-less  compiles
       *.less into css.
           exp install exp-less

       To render a site from 'documents' into 'public'
           exp render

       To serve content and watch for changes
           exp

       To watch for changes but not serve
           exp watch

       To render a matching set of documents
           exp documents/index.html
           exp documents/manual

       To clean the rendered site under 'public'
           exp clean

<B>DIRECTORIES</B>
       Expansive uses the following directories:

           documents   Input web pages to be processed
           files       Files to be copied and not processed
           layouts     For master page layouts
           public      Final output directory containing the rendered web site
           partials    For partial web pages that can  be  included  by  other
       pages

       These directories can be modified via meta 'expansive.directories' col-
       lection.

<B>PROCESSING</B>
       Expansive operates by processing web pages from the 'documents'  direc-
       tory.  It  uses  layout pages from the 'layouts' directory and includes
       partial pages from the 'partials' directory. Raw files  may  be  copied
       from the 'files' directory.  Content is rendered to the 'public' output
       directory.

<B>CONFIGURATION</B>
       Expansive is controlled by an 'expansive.json' configuration file. This
       defines top level configuration for the site and controls how Expansive
       renders the site. An expansive.json file must be present for  Expansive
       to render content.

       To prepare a new site to use Expansive, run:

           exp init

       This creates an expansive.json file. Here is a cut-down portion:

            {
                meta: {
                    title: 'Home page title',
                    url: 'Home page url',
                    description: 'Meta data description (optional)',
                },
                expansive: {
                    copy: [ '**.tags', 'images' ],
                    dependencies: { 'css/all.css.less': 'css/*.inc.less' },
                    documents: [ '**', '!css/*.inc.less' ],
                    plugins: [ 'less', 'css', 'analytics', 'gzip' ],
                    script: `
                        function menu(item) meta.menu == item ? 'active' : ''
                    `
                },
                services: {
                    /* Configuration for plugins */
                }
             }

       Expansive  uses a "liberal" json format that permits comments, unquoted
       property keys and use of multi-line  quotes.  The  layout  and  partial
       page. The 'expansive' collection has properties that control the opera-
       tion of Expansive. These values are made available to web pages via the
       'meta.expansive' property.

       In the expansive section, the 'documents' array defines the set of pat-
       terns to select documents for processing.  The 'copy' array  defines  a
       set  of  patterns  to select files to copy without processing. The copy
       patterns are relative to the 'documents' directory. The 'script' string
       defines an optional global script to inject code into the Ejscript exe-
       cution context. The 'sitemap'  collection  defines  what  documents  to
       include in the created sitemap XML file.

<B>DYNAMIC CONTENT</B>
       Expansive  uses  embedded  Javascript  in  web  pages  to fully support
       dynamic content.  Scripts can be embedded via the special Expansive tag
       '&lt;@  ...   @&gt;'.  This will run the script when the page is rendered and
       replace the script with rendered  data.   When  the  script  runs,  the
       'this'  object  is  set  to  the  'expansive' object for easy access to
       Expansive methods. See SCRIPTING below for more details.

       For example, to render the current date in a document:

        &lt;p&gt;Today is &lt;@ write(Date()) @&gt;

       The write function is used to render data to be used in place of the &lt;@
       @&gt;  element.   You  can  use 'writeSafe' to HTML escape the data before
       writing. You can also use a simpler form &lt;@= that means use the  result
       of  the Javascript expression, HTML escapse the data and then write it.
       For example:

        &lt;p&gt;Today is &lt;@= Date() @&gt;

       Even simpler, you can use an abbreviated @= variable to emit the  value
       of a Javascript variable. For example:

        &lt;p&gt;Site URL is @={meta.url}&lt;/p&gt;

       The top URL of the site may be abbreviated as '@~'.

<B>TRANSFORMATIONS</B>
       Expansive  will  interpret document extensions and automatically trans-
       form content from one format to another.   For  example,  the  filename
       'instructions.html.md'  tells  Expansive  that  the data is in Markdown
       format via the '.md' extension and it should be  converted  to  'html'.
       Expansive  will  examine each nested extension and process the document
       until it reaches an extension for which there is no further transforma-
       tions defined.

       Expansive  uses the '.exp' extension to specify the document has embed-
       ded Ejscript. For example:

            index.html.md.exp

       This means the file has Embedded Ejscript in a Markdown file that  will
       be  compiled  to HTML. Expansive will process this by first running the
       embedded Ejscript, then piping the result through the  Markdown  filter
       and finally saving the result as 'index.html' after applying the appro-
       priate layout.

<B>PLUGINS</B>
       Expansive may be extended via plugins that provide transformations  and
       additional  scripting  capability.  A site specifies the plugins to use
       via the 'expansive.plugins' property. When a plugin  is  installed  via
       'exp  install', the plugin automatically to the ordered 'plugins' list.
       When a plugin is loaded, it registers itself to  handle  specific  file
       extension  transformations.  The  transformation  pipeline for specific
       extensions can be overridden via the

<B>USEFUL PLUGINS</B>
       Here are some of the more useful Expansive plugins:

       exp-bash  Run shell scripts and capture the output

       exp-css   Process CSS files to add browser specific prefixes and minify
                 the  output.  Requires  'autoprefixer'  and  'recess'  to  be
                 installed.

       exp-esp   Compile ESP web pages and applications.

       exp-gzip  Compress final output using gzip. Files are rendered  with  a
                 'gz' extension.

       exp-js    Process  Javascript  files  to  mangle  and  minify. Requires
                 'uglify' to be installed.

       exp-less  Process Less stylesheets into CSS. Requires  'recess'  to  be
                 installed.

       exp-marked
                 Install  the Markdown program. Use with the exp-md plugin for
                 Markdown files.

       exp-md    Process Markdown files and emit html.

       exp-recess
                 Install the recess program. Use with the exp-less plugin  for
                 Less  file processing, and the exp-css file for minifying CSS
                 files.

       exp-sass  Process SASS files into CSS. Requires "sass" to be installed.

       exp-uglifyjs
                 Install  Uglify-js.  Use with the exp-js plugin to mangle and
                 minify Javascripts.

       Many plugins can be customized by passing configuration to  the  plugin
       via  expansive.json  file.  For example: To request that all Javascript
       files be minified, use a '.min.js' extension, and be compressed but not
       managed:

       {
           services: {
               'minify-js': {
                   compress: true,
                   mangle: true,
                   dotmin: true,
               }
           }
        }

        See  specific  plugin  documentation for the configuration options for
       each plugin.

<B>LAYOUTS</B>
       A layout page defines the top level HTML content for a  set  of  pages.
       The  layout  defines  the format, look and feel of the web site so that
       each pages does not need to replicate this content.  Despite  the  fact
       that  pages  nominate  a layout page to use, it is actually layout page
       that includes the content page inside it to create  a  composite  page.
       The  '&lt;@  content @&gt;' tag in the layout is replaced with the actual web
       page data after separating the page meta data.

       There can be multiple layout pages and the  default  layout  is  called
       'default.html.exp'.  Layout  pages  may next, i.e. may use other layout
       pages.  Layout pages can use any desired transformation file extension.

             &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
             &lt;html lang="en"&gt;
             &lt;head&gt;
                 &lt;title&gt;&lt;@= meta.title @&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
                 &lt;link href="css/api.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" /&gt;
             &lt;/head&gt;
             &lt;body&gt;
                 &lt;div class="content"&gt;
                     &lt;@ content @&gt;
                 &lt;/div&gt;
             &lt;/body&gt;
             &lt;/html&gt;

<B>PARTIALS</B>
       Web  pages  often  need  to have content that is common across a set of
       pages. Expansive supports this via partial pages that can  be  included
       by  any  page, layout or other partial page. A page specifies a partial
       by using the 'partial' Javascript function. For example:

        &lt;@ partial('header') @&gt;

       The partial function will search for a file starting with 'header.html'
       in  the  'partials'  directory.   Partials are transformed according to
       their extension. If a partial called  'header.html.md.exp'  was  found,
       then  it  will  be  first transformed by running the embedded Ejscript,
       then piping the output into the Markdown to create html data that  will
       then be included in place of the original partial tag.

       Partials can be nested, in that a partial page may include another par-
       ital page to any depth.

<B>META DATA</B>
       Pages, layouts and partials can define meta data at the top of the file
       via  a  Javascript literal.  Meta data is passed to the Ejscript execu-
       tion context for each page, layout and partial where scripts can  exam-
       ine and use in rendering pages.

             {
                draft: true,
                navigation: 'blog',
             }
             &lt;h1&gt;Page Header&lt;/h1&gt;

       The  meta  data  is  added to the current meta data collection from the
       expansive.json file and passed to the layout page, partials  pages  and
       content  pages.  The  meta  data  can be accessed via the global 'meta'
       Javascript variable.

       Meta data is inherited and aggregated as Expansive processes a web site
       directory.  In  each  directory,  a site may define an 'expansive.json'
       file that provides additional meta data for that directory  level.  The
       meta  data  from upper directories is passed down to lower directories.
       In this manner upper levels can define the parameters  for  subdirecto-
       ries in the site. Meta data is never passed back up the tree.

<B>META PROPERTIES</B>
       Expansive  defines a rich set of meta properties for you to use in your
       pages:

       basename    Basename portion of the public document filename.

       date        Generation date of the document.

       document    Name of the document in  'documents'  that  is  being  pro-
                   cessed.

       extension   The extension of the public document filename.

       extensions  The set of extensions on the original input document.

       file        Filename of the document or partial being processed.

       from        The  filename  extension  being  processed  by  the current
                   transformation.

       isLayout    True if a layout is being processed.

       isPartial   True if a partial page is being processed.

       layout      Layout page in use. Set to '' if no layout being used.

       mode        Index in the modes property. The selected property  collec-
                   tion is copied up to the top level of the meta data.

       partial     Name of the partial page being processed.

       path        Input filename of the document.

       public      Final public filename for the document.

       service     Name of the transformation service being run.

       to          The  destination filename extension after processing by the
                   current transformation.

       top         URL for the top level home page of the site.

       url         URL for the current page.

<B>EXPANSIVE CONTROL</B>
       Expansive defines a set of control  properites  in  the  meta.expansive
       property. These are originally sourced from the

       copy        Array  of patterns to copy without processing. The patterns
                   may include "*" or "**". If a directory  is  specifed,  all
                   files  under  the directory are copied. The files are rela-
                   tive to the documents directory.

       dependencies
                   Hash of file dependency relationships. The hash key is  the
                   document path and the value is a set of files that if modi-
                   fied, cause the document to be rendered. The  document  and
                   files  are  relative to the documents directory. The set of
                   files can be a string or an array of files. Each value file
                   may contain "*" or "**".

       directories Directories  collection.  Entries for 'documents', 'files',
                   'public', 'layouts', and 'partials'.

       documents   Array of patterns to process. The patterns may include  "*"
                   or  "**".  If  a directory is specifed, all files under the
                   directory are processed. The files are relative to the doc-
                   uments directory.

       listen      Address on which to listen for HTTP requests. May be just a
                   port number.

       plugins     List of plugins to use.

       script      Script to  evaluate  to  inject  code  into  the  Expansive
                   Ejscript global execution context.

       sitemap     Control  what  files  to  include in a sitemap. If defined,
                   Expansive will by default include all  HTML  files  in  the
                   sitemap.   To  change the file set included in the sitemap,
                   define a 'files' property with an array of patterns in  the
                   sitemap object.

                   sitemap: {
                      files: [ '**.html', '!draft.html' ],
                   }

       transforms  Hash  of extension mappings to a list of transform services
                   for those mappings. Mappings are in the form 'ext -&gt;  ext'.
                   For example:

                    transforms: {
                       'less -&gt; css': [ 'compile-less', 'prefix-css', 'minify-
                   css', 'compress' ]
                    }

                   Some of the standard service names are:  compile-esp,  com-
                   pile-less,    compile-markdown,   compile-sass,   compress,
                   minify-css, minify-js, prefix-css, shell.

       watch       Time in milliseconds to wait between checking  for  render-
                   ing.

<B>CREATING PLUGINS</B>
       Expansive    plugins    are    created    using    the    Pak   utility
       (https://embedthis.com/pak)  and  published  to  the  Pak  Catalog   at
       (https://embedthis.com/catalog/). The plugin contains an expansive.json
       file that includes transforms relevant to the plugin.  For example:

        {
           expansive: {
               transforms: {
                   name:   'my-transform',
                   input:  'ext1',
                   output: 'ext2',
                   script: '
                       function transform(contents, meta, service) {
                           return transformed data
                       }

           }
        }

       The plugin specifies a one or more transformations via the 'transforms'
       collection.  Each  transform  definition  provides an implemention of a
       transform service. The 'name' property specifies the transform  service
       name.  The  service  name  provides an abstract name for which multiple
       plugins may provide the implementation. The service is selected via the
       'plugins'  property  and Expansive chooses the first plugin that adver-
       tized that service.

       The 'input' property specifies the input  filename  extension  and  the
       'output'  property  specifies  the output extension.  If all extensions
       are supported, set the value to '*'. Both 'input' and 'output'  may  be
       arrays if multiple extensions are supported.

       The  transform  script should define a global 'transform' function that
       will be invoked for matching content.  It is  invoked  with  the  'con-
       tents'  to transform (String), the meta data collection and the service
       object that contains service options.  The function should  return  the
       transformed data.

       A  plugin  may  also  define  other Ejscript functions and variables in
       'script' that will be injected into the global scope of Expansive  when
       it executes.

<B>SCRIPTING</B>
       Expansive defines a top level global named "expansive" to access Expan-
       sive services. This object provides the following methods:

       addItems(collection, items)
              Add items  to  a  named  collection.  Collections  are  globally
              defined  and reset at the start of processing for each document.
              Documents, partials and layouts can inject  items  into  collec-
              tions  for  sharing to other documents. Items may be a string or
              an array of strings. Items are uniquely added to the collection.

       getFiles({key: value})
              To  return  a  list  of  matching  documents that have meta data
              matching the specified keys and values.

       getFileMeta(filename)
              To return the meta data specified in the given file.

       getItems(collection)
              Return the items in a named collection as an Array.

       removeItems(collection, items)
              Remove the specified items from the named collection.

       renderScripts
              Render  all  scripts  added  to  the  'scripts'  collection  via
              'addItems'.  This  permits  documents,  partials  and layouts to
              require Javascripts and have them emitted uniquely by a partial.

       renderStyles
              Render all stylesheets added to the 'styles' and 'inline-styles'
              collections via 'addItems'. This permits documents, partials and
              layouts to require stylesheets and have them emitted uniquely by
              a partial.

       trace(tag, msg...)
              To emit console trace while processing.

<B>COMMANDS</B>
       clean  Remove rendered content from the 'public' output directory.

       init   Initialize a directory by creating an 'expansive.json'  configu-
              ration file.

       install
              Install a plugin from the Pak catalog.

       list   List the installed and uninstalled plugins and packages.

       render Render the site by processing files from 'documents', 'layouts',
              'partials' and 'files' into the 'public' output directory.

       uninstall
              Uninstall a plugin from  the  expansive.json  plugin  list.  The
              plugin remains in the local Pak cache.

       upgrade
              Upgrade a plugin version in the local Pak cache.

       watch  Watch  for  changes to 'documents', 'layouts' and 'partials' and
              render the modified files. Changes to  'layouts'  or  'partials'
              will cause the entire site to be rendered.

       &lt;CR&gt;   Running  exp  without  any arguments will cause run the embedded
              web server to serve the site. By default Expansive  will  listen
              on  port 4000. This can be modified via the 'listen' property in
              the meta collection.

       patterns ...
              Providing a list of patterns to filter the set of  documents  to
              render.   Expansive  will  render  only the documents that begin
              with the given patterns.

<B>OPTIONS</B>
       <B>--chdir directory</B>
                 Change to directory before running.

       <B>--keep URI</B>
                 Keep intermediate files when transforming content. Useful for
                 debugging.

       <B>--listen IP:PORT URI</B>
                 Change  the port on which Expansive will listen. Can omit the
                 IP portion and only specify a port.

       <B>--log filename:level</B>
                 Emit trace to the specified file. The level  is  a  verbosity
                 level from 0-5 with 5 being the most verbose.

       <B>--noclean </B>Do  not  clean  the  'public'  directory before rendering. By
                 default Expansive will remove all the content under  'public'
                 first.

       <B>--norender</B>
                 Do not do an initial render before watching for changes.

       <B>--nowatch </B>Do not watch for changes when serving content.

       <B>--quiet   </B>Run in quiet mode. Do not emit activity trace to the console.

       <B>--trace filename:level</B>
                 Trace HTTP requests to the specified file.  The  level  is  a
                 verbosity level from 0-5 with 5 being the most verbose.  HTTP
                 requests and HTTP headers will be traced at levels 2-4.

       <B>--verbose </B>Run in verbose mode. Emit more activity trace.

       <B>--versions URI</B>
                 Show exp version information.

       <B>--DIGIT   </B>Emit log and HTTP trace to stderr at the specified level. The
                 DIGIT  must  be  0  to 5 with 5 being the most verbose.  This
                 option  is  the   same   as   "--log   stderr:DIGIT   --trace
                 stderr:DIGIT"
